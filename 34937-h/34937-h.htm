<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The material which was originally pland for my monograf in
the Ottendorfer series has since been independently publisht
by Steinert in his dissertation and book on Tieck's color sense and
by O. Fischer in an article, "Ueber Verbindung von Farbe und
Klang" in the <i>Zeitschrift fuer &AElig;sthetik</i>. These three works
renderd the publication of my material superfluous, made a
change of plan necessary and the result is that my monograf has
been very much delayd in appearing.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there is no other study of Tieck's first critical
paper. I found it worth while to do this monograf because
the comparison with the original engraving brought out so many
interesting facts, threw light on Tieck's erly critical method, explaind
his taste, showd his use of sources and above all, contradicted
the positiv assertion of Haym that Lessing's influence
is nowhere discernible. The meny interesting facts about the
gallery itself that came to light in the course of the paper,
the meny questions about it which I was unable to solv, may
perhaps become the matter of another article.</p>

<p>The "Gallery" is for us now a revenant of a past and somewhat
impossible generation. A certain air of English commercial
roastbeefism clings to it. It is an England, the art of which
knows nothing of Constable and still less of Turner, an England
which loves Shakspere without reading him&mdash;as Tieck suspected&mdash;and
whose gallofobia does not recognize the det to France
and the French elements in this very series. As an interpretation
of Shakspere, it is no more than on a plane with Colly Cibber.
Tieck saw this and felt it, but could not make clear to himself
what was wrong with it. The plates belong in parlors of the
haircloth age, where indeed, they may still often be found. It
is before the day of the painted snowshovel and the crayon portrait,
but the delicacy of the Adams' decorations has gone out
and the new strength of Romanticism has not come in. There
is surely no tuch of the Elizabethan or Jacobean spirit.</p>

<p>I wish to take this opportunity to thank the various members
of the staffs of the Stanford University and the Columbia University
Libraries, of the Congressional and New York Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[P:6]</a></span>
Libraries for their aid; especially to thank Mr. Weitenkampf
for his very great help on technical matters. Mr. L. L. Mackall
also furnisht me with very valuable information. The paper
underwent a most searching criticism at the hands of Professor
Wilkens, of New York University and I wish to express my
especial indetedness to him for his assistance in the matter.
To Professor McLouth my thanks are due for a constant kindly
interest in me as Ottendorfer fellow. Finally, it is a plesant
duty to express my appreciation of the benefits derived from
that Fellowship and to thank the Committee for having made
me its third incumbent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. H. D.</p>

<h2><a name="TIECKS_ESSAY_ON_THE_BOYDELL" id="TIECKS_ESSAY_ON_THE_BOYDELL"></a>TIECK'S ESSAY ON THE BOYDELL</h2>
<h2>SHAKSPERE GALLERY</h2>


<p>Tieck's attack<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on the Boydell Shakspere Gallery<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was his first
publisht critical production. It is significant to note that
this first essay in criticism delt both with Shakspere and with art,
that is, with the ruling passion of Tieck's life and with one of
the strongest of his secondary interests. The passion for Shakspere
with the concomitant sense of close personal relationship
with him, came to be a major part of Tieck's being and is clearly
indicated even before this article.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Tieck's decided aversion to
the English national standpoint toward Shakspere is strongly
exprest in the essay. The man who later vainly tried to convert
Coleridge to a point of view with respect to the dramatist that
was opposed to all that was national and English, does not, as a
mere lad, hesitate to venture his douts as to whether the English
nation is equal to the task of illustrating its greatest poet.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>These illustrations are known as the Boydell Shakspere Gallery.
They were the idea of the engraver, Alderman John Boydell,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
who wisht to set up a great national monument to the
genius of Shakspere and, at the same time, to foster a school of
historical painting in a land where heretofore the portrait alone
had attaind to any degree of excellence.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The "Gallery" was
begun in 1789 and was completed in 1803. At no sparing of expense
to himself&mdash;the entire cost was upward of &pound;100,000&mdash;Boydell
commissiond some of the best artists and engravers of the
time to portray scenes from all of Shakspere's plays. The oil
paintings, about 100 in number, were to be permanently housd
in a gallery bilt for the purpose in London and were to be bestowd
on the nation as a perpetual memorial to the great playwright's
genius. The Napoleonic wars, "that Gothic and Vandalic revolution,"
and the deth in poverty of Boydell, renderd necessary
the disposal of the collection by lottery (1804). The lucky ticket
was held by a London connoisseur named Tassie. At his deth
the collection was scatterd, tho subsequently a few of the pictures
were recollected and are now in the Shakspere Memorial
in Stratford.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The plates from these pictures are, all in all, no better and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[P:8]</a></span>
worse than engravings of the day are likely to be. It is illustration
work in which the story interest is the predominant feature.
Interpretation of Shakspere takes precedence over art, and even
Boydell places the painter below the poet and speaks disparagingly
of the ability of the former to understand and to portray.
The purposes of the "Gallery" harmonize with Tieck's point of
view and his predilection for the interpretativ in criticism minimizes
the esthetic aspects of his discussion.</p>

<p>Tieck's essay is in the form of four letters, and was written
while he was a student at the University of G&ouml;ttingen. It had
the approval of his teacher, Johann Dominik Fiorillo, (himself
afterward well-known as the author of an extensiv history of art,)
tho it was not especially written under Fiorillo's gidance.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It
was intended, on the surface at least, as an open and emfatic
protest agenst the too lavish praise of the plates in the journals.
The general tone, then, is polemic tho directed agenst no particular
person or article.</p>

<p>In the preface to his critical works<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Tieck asserts that the article
is a product of the year 1793 and that it was published in
1794. It appeared in the <i>Neue Bibliothek der sch&oelig;nen Wissenschaften
und freyen Kuenste</i>, 55ten Bandes zweytes St&uuml;ck, pages
187-226, which bears the date 1795,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and according to the Messkatalog,
did not appear till Michaelmas of that year.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Tieck's
memory, therefore, faild him as to the date of publication and
he has also fallen into a slite error, or rather inaccuracy, in regard
to the time of origin. The article could not have been
completed within the calendar year 1793, because a number of
the plates that Tieck discusses are dated December 24, 1793, and
could hardly hav got to the continent in the same year. While
it may be possible that the plates were postdated, there is no evidence
of such fact at hand. Moreover, the "Gallery" was reviewd
in the <i>G&oelig;ttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> under dates about six
months after the appearance of the individual plates in England
and these reviews, as will be shown hereafter, were extensivly
used by Tieck. In these reviews, the plates are always spoken
of as recently arrived. The prints were issued regularly to the
subscribers, of whom the University, according to the Ms. catalog
in the Boston Public Library, was one.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is hardly to be
supposd that the young student would have erlier access to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[P:9]</a></span>
pictures than the reviewer for the semi-official university publication.
This reviewer was Heyne<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who afterward mediated the
publication of Tieck's article. The article was no dout written
before Tieck settled in Berlin in the Fall of 1794 but its writing
went out over the confines of 1793. The next series of plates
appeard in June, 1794, and is not included in Tieck's article,
tho this is no proof that the article was completed before June,
since the plates probably did not arrive in Germany till well in
the Summer.</p>

<p>Tieck's essay has been almost entirely neglected by Tieck
scholars. It is not a great piece of constructiv criticism, nor
can it be said to contain the ripe judgments of a mature mind.
It is, however, a fresh and, on the whole, convincing analysis of
the plates and as such deserves a careful examination. It will
be seen that the article has a very definit foundation in preceding
criticism but that Tieck, tho borrowing freely from one
source at least, namely the <i>G&oelig;ttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen</i>, has not
slavishly plagiarized nor has he been servil in his adoption of the
ideas of others. And it is also worth noting that Tieck's criticism
was regarded as sufficiently authorativ by Fiorillo to have
been used as a partial source for the latter's critique of the Boydell
plates.</p>

<p>Tieck claims that the praise of the "Gallery" in the contemporary
magazines is excessiv. This claim is exaggerated. Meny
important magazines do not discuss the plates even where there
was an excellent opportunity. So, for example, Wieland's <i>Mercur</i>
and Nicolai's <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i> do not mention
them, tho from time to time engravings from other contemporary
paintings are discust. For instance, Nicolai's journal has
one long discussion of the state of contemporary art, especially
of engraving (No. 110, 1792) but omits all reference
to the Boydell series. The criticism in Meusel's <i>Museum fuer
Kuenstler</i> is on the whole, destructiv. One discussion, for
example, (No. IV, page 99) is a violent attack on engraving in
general and calls the "Gallery," "Diese die Malerei zu grunde
richtende Gelegenheit," and condems the "Kr&auml;mergeist" at the
bottom of the enterprize. The value of line in engraving is,
however, pointed out, and Bartolozzi and Ryland, who had but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[P:10]</a></span>
little to do with the series are faintly praisd. Other mention
in Meusel's magazines is either entirely unoriginal summary
(<i>Museum</i>, VI, 352) or mere cursory comment (<i>Miscellaneen</i>,
St&uuml;ck 30.) The articles on caricature (Neue <i>Miscellaneen</i> X.,
154 and Archiv I, 66) are so late that they cannot be taken into
consideration in connection with Tieck's paper.</p>

<p>With the <i>G&oelig;ttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> the case is different.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Tieck saw and used its articles as a basis for his work, tho the
credit of having written the first connected essay from a single
viewpoint belongs to him. The not over laudatory criticisms of
the <i>Anzeigen</i> are often paralel, even down to the wording of details
with Tieck's judgments, but it would be a mistake to suppose
that Tieck used the articles without having seen the engravings
and without having given the pictures careful consideration.
The fact that Tieck follows the errors of the <i>Anzeigen</i>
is significant, but it is equally significant that he corrects the
errors of the magazine from his stock of observd judgments.
Generally, where Tieck follows the <i>Anzeigen</i> most closely he is
at his worst. The somewhat superficial and scanty remarks of
the journal were no surrogate for the clear vision and power of
adaptibility of the young man. Tieck's personal regard for
Shakspere, which amounted to a real passion, was entirely
wanting.</p>

<p>The use of the articles in the <i>Anzeigen</i> must be shown in detail,
and Tieck's indetedness must be definitly brought out.
Paralels will sometimes show convergence and sometimes divergence
of ideas, but in general it will be seen that Tieck practically
never used his material without some personal addition.</p>

<p>There is one set of cases which is peculiar and which deservs
special attention. The plates in question are: "Much Ado,"
III, 1, ditto IV, 2, and "As You Like It," last scene.</p>

<p>A word of explanation in regard to the Boydell plates is necessary.
From the original paintings there were two sets of
plates engraved, known as the large plates (L) and the small
plates (S). The small plates were in all but a few cases done
from different pictures than were the large ones. These large
plates are those usually known as the Boydell Gallery. Both
sets were issued serially; the large set was also bound and issued
as a separate volume in 1803, and the small plates were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[P:11]</a></span>
used as illustrations for the Steevens Shakspere edition of 1802,
the letter press of which also seems to have been issued in parts
before the bound volumes were finally put on the market. The
bulk of Tieck's criticisms applies to the large plates tho he has
a few remarks on the small ones as well. When he discusses
the small plates, he always mentions the fact, except in the
three cases just cited. These are three of the cases where L and
S coincide in subject matter and where additional S plates were
afterwards printed as a gratuitous gift to the subscribers.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
These plates are among the first discust by the <i>Anzeigen</i> (1791,
page 1794) which mention the fact of the plates being for the
Shakspere edition, and that the extra plates are to be furnisht
to make up for the duplication of subject matter in these cases
of L and S. This is what is meant by the sentence, "Es wird
sogar die Austauschung des einen Kupfers k&uuml;nftig versprochen,"
a statement that corresponds perfectly with the remark in the
later Boydell catalog that this promis has been fulfild. Tieck
does not notis this statement of the <i>Anzeigen</i> but treats these S
plates as if they were L, yet gives the names of the engravers
of S. This would look like a clear case of careless copying
from the <i>Anzeigen</i> if it were not clear from the additions that
Tieck makes to the latter's criticism that he saw the plates too.
The explanation of the discrepancy may be that Tieck when he
was writing his article consulted the <i>Anzeigen</i> for the facts in
regard to the engravers, did not notis that the S plates were referd
to and carelessly copied down what he saw.</p>

<p>I shall now examin in detail some of the paralel criticisms.</p>

<p>Much Ado, II; 4, G. G. A. 1791, page 1794: ... "wo in der
Trauung statt des Jaworts Pedro die Hero f&uuml;r keine reine Jungfer
erkl&auml;rt, und Hero in Ohnmacht f&auml;llt; ... Das beste St&uuml;ck
von allen in R&uuml;cksicht der Composition, Ausdrucks und Auswahl
des Lichtes nur ist die Stellung der Hauptperson ein wenig zu
theatralisch; sonst aber alles gut geordnet; sch&ouml;ne Contraste
von Licht und Ruhe f&uuml;r das Auge."</p>

<p>Tieck, page 19: "Das zweite Blatt enth&auml;lt die Vertossung
der Hero ... und dies ist offenbar eines der vorz&uuml;glichsten.
Das Licht ist sehr gut geordnet, das Auge findet sogleich unter
den Gruppen einen Ruhepunkt; nur hat Hamilton dem Claudio
eine zu theatralische Stellung und dem Leonato zu wenig Ausdruck
gegeben."</p>

<p>Tieck carries the praise of the <i>Anzeigen</i>, the "Das beste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[P:12]</a></span>
St&uuml;ck" of which refers only to the group under immediate discussion,
to the whole series. He takes his main critical vocabulary
from the prototype and adds the original differentiation of
Claudio and Leonato to which reference must be made later.</p>

<p>"Much Ado," IV, 2; G. G. A., 1791, page 1794: ... "ein
Gemisch von verkr&uuml;ppelten, unedeln Caricaturen ohne alle
Grazie ... Zu bedauren ist die Kunst, die an den Stich
verwendet ist; denn der Stich ist einer der besten." Tieck's
criticism of this plate is paralel in so far as he praises the mechanical
perfection of the engraver, who is Heath of S, and not
Simon of L. So far we have the blind following of the model.
But Tieck also makes the picture a basis for a long discussion of
caricature and of thoro condemnation of Smirke, who is also no
favorit of the <i>Anzeigen</i>. As Tieck's letters show a profuse use
of the word caricature, he need not be especially indeted to the
<i>Anzeigen</i> for it.</p>

<p>"Richard III," I, 1, G. G. A., 1791, page 1795. Here Tieck's
borrowing is direct. G. G. A.: "Eine schlechte Composition,
ohne Ausdruck." Tieck, page 27: "Die Composition ist schlecht,
alle Figuren sind ohne Ausdruck." G. G. A.: "Eine Menge Reflexe,
Wiederscheine s. w. aber alles dieses macht keine Wirkung,
und das Auge findet keinen Ruhepunkt." Tieck, page 28:
"und sucht durch unendlich viele Wiederscheine ...
dass das Auge bei den vielen Lichtmassen gar keine Ruhe findet."
But again, besides these verbal and associational paralels,
Tieck has added a free treatment of the composition, an examination
of the drawing of the figures, of which there is no hint
in the model and, all in all, makes the criticism his own. The
impulse certainly came from the <i>Anzeigen</i>, but the whole critique
is a product of Tieck's self.</p>

<p>"Richard III," IV, 3, G. G. A., 1791, page 1795: "Stellung
gezwungen." Tieck, page 28: "Der M&ouml;rder unnat&uuml;rlich."
Here Tieck borrowed the idea and after an examination of the
plate changed the wording.</p>

<p>"As You Like It," II, 1, G. G. A., 1793, page 561: "Ein
treffliches Landschaftsgem&auml;lde." Tieck, page 18: "die reizende
Landschaft." An examination of the whole of Tieck's criticism
shows that he has added a characterization of Jacques, has discust
the choice of this particular subject, and in this connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[P:13]</a></span>
shows especially that the plate under discussion is only a vignette
to the plays and not a part of the real play itself.</p>

<p>"As You Like It," last scene, G. G. A., 1793, pages 561-2:
"Orlando, der mit zeimleich ausgespreizeten Beinen." Tieck,
page 18: "Seine augespreizten Beine machen ihn widrig."
Here Tieck has taken an externality of the description and has
given it a point. The use of the word "widrig" gives a new
tuch.</p>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet," I, 5, G. G. A.: "die Hauptfiguren muss
man suchen." Tieck, page 29: "Die Hauptfiguren findet man
nur mit einiger M&uuml;he." Notis, however, how Tieck then goes on
independently to giv his own point: "den Vater der Julie kann
man nur errathen; Julie selbst hat wenig Character. Tybald
ist die ausdruckvollste Figur auf diesem Blatte." Tieck also
quotes in full the passage beginning, "If I profane with my unworthy
hand" which the <i>Anzeigen</i> only indicates. This might
be laid to yuthful pedantry, were the whole not made far
clearer for the entire citation.</p>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet," IV, 5, G. G. A., 562: "Julia nach genommenem
Schlaftrunk f&uuml;r todt gehalten, mit den Worten des
M&ouml;nchs: Peace ho for shame! ff. Dieser tr&ouml;stend, die Mutter
die H&auml;nde ringend, Paris Julien umfassend, ein St&uuml;ck mit vielem
Affect" ... Tieck, page 30: "Julie hat den Schlaftrunk genommen
und scheint gestorben, ihre Aeltern sowie ihr Br&auml;utigam
Paris sind in Verzweifelung, der Pater sucht Alle zu tr&ouml;sten."
In the discussion of the small plate which follows, the
<i>Anzeigen</i> points out the changes which have been made on it,
this being one of the supplementary small plates for the 1802
text edition. Tieck also notises the fact of the change but that
he took his information not only from the <i>Anzeigen</i> but from an
examination of the original is proved by his additions to the information
of the <i>Anzeigen</i>. Tieck's comment is, "Mehrere unn&uuml;tze
Personen weggelassen." This reason goes at least one
step farther than the <i>Anzeigen</i> comment. In the magazine, the
effect of the double light in L is adversly criticized. Tieck adds
to this, "Der alte Capulet hat auf beiden Bl&auml;ttern wenig Ausdruck."
That both Tieck and the magazine use the fraze "tut
... Wirkung" in this place seems of secondary importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[P:14]</a></span>
A mere linguistic reminiscence, where it is not connected with
an idea, is not influence. This must be sought in basic ideas, in
hints which point the way for new lines of thought, in an adoption
of facts. An author like Tieck shows independence when
he adds, eliminates and remolds what he receives, even tho the
form of the thought clings often to him.</p>

<p>So, then, when the <i>Anzeigen</i> (1793, page 562) has the fraze
"Julie in dem Grabgew&ouml;lbe erwachend," the fact that Tieck
(page 30) introduces his criticism with the words, "Julie erwacht,
als der M&ouml;nch eben in das Gew&ouml;lbe tritt," is of slite consequence.
This is a simple description of fact. Of much more
importance is the fact that the magazine goes on to point out
that not nature but the stage should be the model for the painter
in this case, a doctrin which Tieck not only does not mention,
but in fact, utterly rejects when the time comes to discuss it in
the course of the treatment.</p>

<p>In the criticism of Schiavonetti's plate after Angelica Kaufmann
(G. G. A., 1793, page 903; Tieck, pages 16-17) Tieck agrees
with the <i>Anzeigen</i> but is thoroly independent in his resoning
and adds constantly to what the magazine asserts. That
both find the disguisd Julia beautiful is not unresonable, and
as the disguise is a part of the play it is not strange that Tieck
mentions it. In the same section of the magazine is a passage
which finds a later echo in Tieck. "K&ouml;nig Lear reisst sich die
Kleider vom Leibe" (903). Tieck (32): "und reisst sich endlich
die Kleider ab." The verbal paralelism has significance here
only because there are other hints at this time which may hav
aided Tieck: e. g., the fact that the artist has departed from
the scene as Shakspere portrayd it. Tieck is definit in stating
just who is added, which proves that he knew his Shakspere
and saw the plate. Tieck also points out the spiritual difference
between Shakspere and the "famous West," a distinct addition
to the matter in the <i>Anzeigen</i>. "Winter's Tale," II, 3, G. G.
A., 1794, page 9: "Der eifers&uuml;chtige Leontes l&auml;sst den Antigonous
bey seinem ihm vorgehalten Schwerte schw&ouml;ren, dass er
das Kind, das ihm seine Gemahlin geboren hatte, in eine Ein&ouml;de
aussetzen will. Sind gemeine Figuren." Notis how in Tieck,
while the general terms of the description are the same, because
following the line of least resistance in externalities, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[P:15]</a></span>
discussion takes on an individual character, and is expanded
into a critique of Opie's drawing which was always unsatisfactory
to Tieck. Tieck (page 21): "Der eifers&uuml;chtige Leontes
l&auml;sst den Antigonus schw&ouml;ren, das Kind auszusetzen....
An den Darstellungen aus diesem St&uuml;cke ist viel zu tadeln, vorz&uuml;glich
an dieser ersten Scene. Leontes, die Hauptperson, ist
steif und ohne allen Ausdruck, alle &uuml;brigen Personen sind dick
und plump gezeichnet und ganz ohne alle Bedeutung. Leontes
l&auml;sst den Antigonus, so wie Hamlet seine Gef&auml;hrten, bei seinem
Schwerte schw&ouml;ren. Schauspieler und Zeichner aber fehlen,
wenn sie es so vorstellen, wie Opie es hier gethan hat. Die
alten Schwerter bilden oben am Griffe ein Kreuz und auf dieses
legte man die Hand, in Ermangelung eines eigentlichen Crucifixes....
In diesem Blatte entdecken sich auch bald
viele Fehler in der Zeichnung. Das Auge wird von der Hauptperson
auf die Lichtmasse, folglich, auf das Kind hingezogen;
die Hauptfigur tritt gar nicht genug hervor, sondern h&auml;ngt mit
den hinter ihr stehenden zusammen; die K&ouml;pfe im Hintergrunde
sind eben so gross, wie die der vorderen Personen. Alles verr&auml;th
den unge&uuml;bten K&uuml;nstler." As an example of Tieck's rejection
of the opinion of the G. G. A., the discussion of "Winter's
Tale," V, 3, will suffice. This is the statue scene which Tieck
absolutely condems on account of poor engraving, expression
and posing. Where the magazine says "Die Statue, der man es
doch sehr gut ansieht, das es eine lebende Figur ist, macht
grosse Wirkung." Tieck (22) contradicts thus: "Die Statue ist
sehr unnat&uuml;rlich, sie sieht mehr einem Geiste, als einem Menschen
&auml;hnlich."</p>

<p>There are, finally, three further cases in which Tieck takes a
hint from the <i>Anzeigen</i> and develops it. "2 Henry VI," III, 3,
(1794, page 10): "Kardinal Beauford ... ein scheuslicher
Anblick, in mehr als einem Verstande." Tieck (page 25):
"Dieses abscheuliche Blatt." But Tieck, in a passage too long
to quote, goes on to giv cogent reasons for not liking the picture,
not one of which is derived from the <i>Anzeigen</i>. The other
passages from the "Merry Wives" (I, 1 and II, 1, G. G. A., 1794,
page 970; Tieck, 11-12) take the hint that Smirke drew caricatures
and not human beings and borrow the adjectiv "widrig."
With this slender borrowing Tieck develops a full discussion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[P:16]</a></span>
Smirke and of these plates with no further assistance from the
<i>Anzeigen</i> than a hint on the engraving of textiles.</p>

<p>These passages on "Henry VI" and on the "Merry Wives" are
doubly interesting, however, because they show that Tieck's
judgment of Smirke and Northcote offers a very close paralel to
that of the magazine. Tieck's reasons are fuller, but they show
no more ability in Tieck than in the reviewer of the <i>Anzeigen</i> to
understand some of the most characteristic features of English
humor as exemplified in Smirke, while the pupil and biografer of
Sir Joshua fares badly because of his alleged bad composition
and poor light effects. It will be shown later that on both of
these latter questions Tieck held views quite independent of the
<i>Anzeigen</i>.</p>

<p>Of Kirk's plate from "Titus Adronicus" the G. G. A., 1794,
page 970, says, "Den Ausdruck an der Lavinia abgerechnet
ein gut St&uuml;ck." Tieck (28) begins with a weak, "an dem
Blatte ... ist vielleicht viel zu loben und wenig zu tadeln"
but "rights himself like a soldier" thus, "Man sieht, dass der
K&uuml;nstler eine sehr richtige Idee von der Composition hat, und
dass er seinem Gegenstand mit Geschmack und Delicatesse zu
behandeln weiss. Er l&auml;sst uns die abgeschnittenen Arme der
Lavinia nur vermuthen; der geschickt geworfene Schleier entzieht
unserm Auge den unangenehmen Anblick," etc.</p>

<p>The examples and paralels alredy given cover practically all of
the points of similarity between Tieck and his model. They
show that Tieck used the <i>Anzeigen</i> constantly and minutely but
they can not fail to impress the reader with the fact that Tieck
invariably rises above the plane of the jottings in the magazine
in form and in substance. The content of Tieck's criticisms is very
much greater than that of his prototype and the form is far more
polisht. These apercus of Heyne did not prevent Tieck's independent
thinking; they never fettered him. He followd them
in a number of places in his paper and once or twice falls into
their error thru youthful carelessness or misapprehension. They
did not often confuse his judgment or hamper his vision. He
never ruthlessly plagiarizd them. That they were a source can
not be denied, but that they form the real basis of Tieck's
critique is not for a moment tenable. This came unquestionably
from himself, and he must be given credit or blame for the good
or bad in it.</p>

<p>Tieck set about the task of criticising the "Boydell Gallery"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[P:17]</a></span>
with no diffidence, but with many misgivings, amounting almost
to prejudises, as to the valu of the set of plates. He was aware
that this work was intrinsically in a class which is, all in all, artistically
inferior. His judgments are objectiv, but they promis
no prescience of a higher, a more spiritual attitude toward art.
Art in this case servs interpretation and the struggle away from
what the plates represent has hardly commenced. Tieck feels
that the whole group does not do Shakspere justis, but he nowhere
says that the subjectiv interpretation of the poet must remain
the lasting one for the individual; indeed he asserts quite
the contrary on the very first page of his paper. It is to be expected
that Tieck's common sense and fancy should rebel at the
platitudinarianism of the pictures; that at times he is no more
than on the plane of the sentimental "Enlightenment" is also
to be expected. The valu of the study is in such harsh negativ
criticism as it exercises where emfasis is false or where bad
taste prevails in the performance of the artists' task.</p>

<p>Tieck came to the work with a good first-hand knowledge of
Shakspere and this lessens the juvenile and jejune qualities of
his work. He is weaker on the comedies than on the trajedies,
for the former require a keener sensing of English life than it
was possible for Tieck to hav obtaind at the time of writing.
But even for the comedies, some of his observations are very
just and show that he could interpret Shakspere with sense and
precision. The present discussion will attempt to find out by a
careful examination of the plates just what Tieck saw in these
pictures and how far his interpretation was right. The results
should show, in a general way, something of the powers of interpretation
possest by the youthful Tieck, and how this power of
interpretation conditiond his judgments.</p>

<p>The general theoretical standpoint upon which the essay was
written is that of Lessing, and a careful perusal will show that
Haym was wrong when he postulated no Lessing influence on
the article.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Tieck's letters to Wackenroder show that he was
reading the Laokoon at this time, but even if a preoccupation
with Lessing were not easily postulable, the matter of the paper
itself will show a distinct recrudescence of Lessing's ideas. And
not only Lessing, but the school of critics out of which Lessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[P:18]</a></span>
arose, e. g., Winkelmann and DuBos, were also a part of Tieck's
reading.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The article has a total lack of coloristic reflexes; it emfasizes
form, if not line; its thoro reasonableness takes into consideration
all that Lessing has stood for in the domain of art. It has
the same standpoint as that of a Goethe returnd from Italy and
of a Karl Philipp Moritz from whom, to be sure, Tieck was turning
away in disgust.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The article fails to solv the problem in Tieck's mind of reconciling
his natural desire away from the regulated and calm
with the current and traditional in British art. The conflict is
between a desire in theory for moderated effects, for the toning
down of emotion, and a desire, in practis, for strong contrast
and superlativ effects. Lessing, in art the enemy of all realism,
finds in Tieck a condemer of Hogarth, a condemnation that
persists in Tieck as late as the essay on the erly English Theater
(1828),<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and persists on grounds similar to the fundamental
principle of beauty laid down by Lessing.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to argu from the foregoing that in this
article Tieck was not a realist, or at least strongly inclined toward
realism in his practis. His realism was that of the yung enthusiast
for whom each variation from the sense of his idol was a
blasfemy, and he points out (page 24) that there can be none of
that deception of the senses which is a part of the pictorial arts
where "ich irgend eine auffallende Unnat&uuml;rlichkeit entdecke;
denn die Nachahmung der Natur ist der Zweck des K&uuml;nstlers."
Such strict imitation of nature is more to be expected, to be
sure, in the work of the lesser lights, such as are the men who
did the pictures for the "Gallery," than in the work of a real
genius, and one is glad to overlook, in the works of the latter,
those minor faults which almost entirely disappear in the face
of a thousand beauties. So, says Tieck (page 14) "who would
pass by the divine masterpieces of a Rafael and yet with weighty
mien find fault with the bad coloring of a single garment?"
There are clearly two kinds of artist. The one is the genius who
may be carried too far by his enthusiasm, the other is the colder
painter, who by his choice of subject, composition, correctness
of drawing, and grace must make up for his lack of genius, and
who can not hope to attain the emotional effects of his rival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[P:19]</a></span>
but who must be content to arouse a cooler feeling, that is, the
satisfaction of the spectator. In this series, where genius is excluded
from the outset, Tieck expects a strict adherence to fact,
to verisimilitude, and the correct interpretation of Shakspere
must be insisted on.</p>

<p>In order that the soul may get an immediate enjoyment of the
work of art, Tieck recommends (page 4) that the painter choose
well-known subjects. He says: "The soul passes immediately
to the enjoyment of the work of art and curiosity does not stand
in the way of his enjoyment as in the case of obscure or unknown
subjects. I am alredy prepared for the sentiment that the work
of art is to arouse in me, and surrender myself all the more willingly
to the illusion. If the subject of the picture is in itself
beautiful and sublime, or if a great poet has furnisht the painter
with the invention, the composition and the emotions, our enthusiasm
is arousd, we giv our wonder and our delight to the
painter."</p>

<p>The painter, then, is only an interpreter of the poet, whose
purpose it is to seize the spirit of the poet, to portray those fine
and spiritual ideas which only a related genius can grasp and
make concrete by an appeal to the senses thru color-magic<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the
intangible creations of the poet's brain. He makes lasting what
the reader gets but a fleeting glimpse of, and what even the
actor can giv but little permanence (page 3).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not Tieck was influenced by the prospectus to the
set, indeed, whether he saw it or not, there is no way of knowing,
but his statement that these pictures in their entirety will
form a national gallery of historical paintings which will drive
the scenes from Greek mythology out of England, is much like
Boydell's own statement of purpose mentiond above. It is also
an erly paralel to the Romantic insistence on a new mythology,
a nativ mythology, rather than one drawn from foren sources
which was a part of Friedrich Schlegel's canon.</p>

<p>The engravings as such are treated by Tieck under five different
heds. These are: the mechanical technique, drawing with
perspectiv and line, composition (which Tieck does not clearly
differentiate from design), expression and choice of subject.
These five heds comprize all the points in which the pictures
are treated, but not each picture is treated from all five. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[P:20]</a></span>
five giv, however, the full range of Tieck's ideas on the engravings.
They show the things that attracted his attention, and
where the influence of the <i>Anzeigen</i> is felt, they serv to show
how different, after all, his own ideas were. Often the magazine
does not tuch one or more points of the five.</p>

<p>Tieck's discussion of the technique of the engravings is, as
may be expected, rather thin, and the frazes that he uses are
stereotyped. Several of the plates praisd by him are quite without
merit and such generalities as, "sch&ouml;n gestochen," "vorz&uuml;glich,"
"vortrefflich gut," are not very significant. Negativ
praise like "nichts zu tadeln" or "die Ausf&uuml;hrung verdient alles
Lob" show that on technical points Tieck was judging very
superficially and that his attention to the "Gallery" had been
attracted by something else than the perfection of the plates.</p>

<p>These engravings are in the now old-fashiond stipple, tho
parts of them are in line. At the time of writing, Tieck may
not hav known the difference between line and stipple, tho in
"Zerbino" a reference to the "pointed manner," used in a punning
way, shows that by that time Tieck had become acquainted
with it.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Nor does Tieck indicate in any way the "Gallery's"
sparing use of the increasingly popular mezzotint. He makes
no mention of the line manner of Flaxman, if he knew him. He
does not see that the line engravings in the set are poorer all
thru than the stipple prints, and that in some of the line plates
the cutting is so deep and the execution so clumsy that the resulting
plates are muddy and crude and are lacking in tone, grace,
and even in exactness of execution.</p>

<p>In one or two places where satin is excellently reproduced,
Tieck praises the texture of the fabrics. The large plate by Simon
from the "Merry Wives" has a wonderful lace apron which
a recent writer on engraving has cald one of the best examples
of the stipple manner.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> As Tieck refers to the other fabrics on
the plate, which is one of those with duplicated subject and
which in the <i>Anzeigen</i> seems only to hav been discust in the S
form, it seems clear that Tieck also saw L here, as S is by no
means so fine a plate; in fact L has the best fabrics in the series.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-four large plates discust by Tieck, there are
only thirteen which receive technical criticisms and of these
thirteen, three are lumpt together under one comment so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[P:21]</a></span>
in all there are only ten separate technical criticisms. Of these,
six occur in the first six plates and with the eighteenth plate,
Kirk's scene from "Titus Andronicus," the criticism of the mechanical
side ends with a weak, "sehr gut gestochen," showing
that Tieck did not progress in his technical criticisms. His interest
in the engravings as engravings waned as the essay proceeded:
it never rose above an attention to textiles and, even
there, Tieck did not see all the finer differentiations of velvet,
chiffon and lace, tho the fine satins distinctly appeald to him.
Perhaps as fair an example as any of his inexactness, is his
praise of the plate from "As You Like It" in which Jacques lies
watching the wounded deer (II, 1). This is one of the poorest
of the plates and yet Tieck says, "Die Ausf&uuml;hrung verdient alles
Lob." Fittler's plate from "Winter's Tale" (IV, 2), while
weak and without character, is not as bad either in actual cutting
or in general managment, and yet Tieck condems it unmercifully.
So, too, the bad plates by Middiman come in for no
special condemnation from Tieck, tho Middiman is by far the
worst engraver in the series, and is particularly bad after Hodges,
the plates after whom Tieck saw.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Drawing, as such, fares rather better than engraving, tho less
than half the pictures are criticized from this standpoint. Colorless
expressions like "Keine Fehler" and "Viele Fehler" are
not wanting and in many cases where whole bodies are out of
drawing or where individual parts are bad Tieck has nothing
to say.</p>

<p>It is especially interesting to note that Tieck finds the drawing
of Angelika Kaufmann without error. ("Two Gent. Verona,"
last scene). Here he declares that no clumsy clothing
conceals the figures, but the lines are well brought out under the
garments. The disguised Julia is at once recognizable in spite of
her masculin attire, and the manner of the artist is "grazi&ouml;s."
An examination of the figure shows that Julia's figure has something
of the immature in it and that the face is rather boyish.
One thinks at once of the somewhat malicious words of Friedrich
Schlegel to his brother, "Wie Angelika Kaufmann, der die Busen
und H&uuml;ften, auch immer wie von selbst aus den Fingern quellen."
Both Tieck and Schlegel felt the sensuous charm of the
painter whose best known self-portrait is in the garb of a Vestal
Virgin, tho the Schlegels, like Georg Forster, had no illusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[P:22]</a></span>
as to the qualities of her art.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Engravings in stipple emfasize less than line engravings mere
questions of drawing. It is perhaps with some instinctiv feeling
for this that Tieck suggests that one of Hamilton's pictures
has been hurt by the bad engraving, just as certain other plates
have gaind thru the engraver (page 22). The hint for this point
came originally from the <i>Anzeigen</i> but Tieck has developt it.
While it is now no longer possible to check up each plate with
its corresponding picture, it is true that the engravers were
relatively better craftsmen, as a rule, than the painters. In
hardly any one case is the painting a sample of the best work of
the artist. Often, as in the case of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the
painting redounds but little to his credit.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Where, as in the
case of Barry, Sir Joshua's great rival, the picture is reckond
with his superior work, the only conclusion is that Barry was a
very bad artist and so Tieck considers him. The engravers, on
the other hand, had had no better chance in years to exhibit
their art than in this imposing series, and most of the best
names in stipple appear in it. The best that Tieck does to recognize
this fact is in the occasional lament for the waste of good
labor on a bad subject or painting (e. g., page 20).</p>

<p>Besides having the good feeling for the human form under the
garment, as in the case of the figure of Julia and of those of
Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page by Smirke, Tieck also criticizes several
cases of misdrawing. So, the clumsy legs of one of Opie's
figures are scored and in blaming this failing of Opie, Tieck hits
one of the most pronounced weaknesses of that artist both in
the "Gallery" and in Bell's British Theater. But Opie, the
"Comedy Wonder," is hardly the "unge&uuml;bter K&uuml;nstler" that
Tieck makes him out to be. Here Tieck, following the criticism
of the <i>Anzeigen</i>, from which he may have got the hint on Opie's
drawing, develops the criticism too far and goes astray. There
is a constant suspicion that Tieck is trying to master a jargon.</p>

<p>Often it is a mere chance whether Tieck will see or not see a
peculiarity. Some of the sentimental, foolish, and misdrawn
hands escape his notis, whereas in other cases he criticizes them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of Tieck's criticism of drawing is
that of Northcote's plate to "Richard III." (III, 1, page 27).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[P:23]</a></span>
He says, "Der alte Cardinal scheint ganz verzeichnet zu sein,
man ist ungewiss, ob er steht oder kniet: in beiden F&auml;llen ist die
Zeichnung fehlerhaft." Tieck's strictures are correct. The
space from the waist down is found upon examination to be abnormally
long for a kneeling person, and groteskly short for one
standing. Tieck's critique is good, for it points out the error
and the reason, and shows that in any case the alternativ is a
bad one.</p>

<p>Tho Tieck may hav been over-kind to Angelika Kaufmann, he
quite agrees with his contemporaries in the condemnation of another
German Swiss living in England, namely F&uuml;essli, whom he
calls one of the worst of the admirers of Michaelangelo. The
michaelangelesk school of the day faild in its expression of
great muscular effort, in that it put for strength distortion and
violence. F&uuml;essli was one of the most important adherents, or
rather, was the greatest representativ of the fad perhaps anywhere
and seems therby to hav largely incurd the displesure of
his German critics. That Tieck really understood Michaelangelo
is shown by his later article in the "Phantasien &uuml;ber die Kunst."
He defends him from the charge of having drawn to show his
knowledge of anatomy and among other things, exclaims on his
"greatness, his wild grace, his fearful beauty."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But Tieck had
no use for those of his imitators who caught only the extravagance
of his figures and debased his Titanic creations into bizarre
contortions by over-emfasis on mere muscle.</p>

<p>That Tieck was not unconscious of the effect of mere line is
shown by his pointing out the unplesantness of the line made
by Leontes' figure in Hamilton's picture of the statu scene from
"Winter's Tale." Awkwardness and violence, anything that
savord of "affectation and bombast," where in Shakspere "power
and energy" are found, met Tieck's disapproval. So this figure
of Leontes, so Orlando standing with his legs far apart, so the
faces drawn by F&uuml;essli. Wherever there were violent angles,
sharp points and corners, Tieck felt himself ill at ease. When
he saw in some of F&uuml;essli's plates faces which giv the impression
of the plaster blocks of the art schools that are used to draw
from the cast, the square chins, the noses, either very pointed
or cut off square, imprest him as repulsivly inhuman. "Widrig,
unnat&uuml;rlich, abgeschmackt, manierirt," are the terms applied to
F&uuml;essli's cursing scene from Lear.</p>

<p>It would hav been interesting had Tieck seen F&uuml;essli's later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[P:24]</a></span>
scenes in the "Gallery." The Bottom scenes from the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" show that fantastic imagination which
was the artist's strong point. All the forms from the fairy world
were there, Moth, Peascod and a welth of other spirits. There
is a distinct appeal to the imagination which justifies the painter
of "Die Nachtmahr," tho the faces of Titania and Oberon are
here too hard and sullen. But the imagination shown has a
curious similarity with the work of Tieck in his later stories such
as "Die Elfen," and which has so warm an afterglow in "Die
Vogelscheuche."</p>

<p>Composition means for Tieck especially order. He has not
yet lernd the principle of triangulation of arrangement enunciated
by Caroline in the "Gem&auml;lde" essay in the <i>Athenaeum</i>.
He expects no more than that the principle character shall be
in an important place in the picture and insists that the lighting
devices serv to throw such personages into relief. So when the
perspectiv is bad it is because of the wrong emfasis on the principal
figures rather than that the harmony of the whole is disturbed
by a wrong arrangement.</p>

<p>What irritates Tieck especially is an arrangement of figures
in the picture in the regular semi-circle borrowd directly from
the theater. The evil of unnaturalness which such attitudinizing
brings with it, is enhanced by light effects drawn from the
same source. So, for example, where the light is that of a lamp,
only so much light as a lamp would giv, or the effect of natural
lamp-light is allowable. If, on the other hand, the sunlight
streams into the room, the source of the sunlight should be evident
as outside the room. Tieck might hav mentiond as an example
of this some of the fine interiors of Pieter De Hoogh. The
light effects should not be harsh but graded down so that no violent
light contrasts occur within the same room. The light,
too, should be broken up, not kept in a mass as if it were a separate
entity to be treated apart from all other objects.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly resonable and not especially technical.
It is conveyd in stray hints rather than in any set discussion of
light effects in any one place. Often, too, Tieck's dislike for
some other aspect of a painter's work leads him astray on this
point. This is tru in the case of Northcote, whose really good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[P:25]</a></span>
treatment of the high lights Tieck has in one or two cases entirely
overlookt. There seems to hav been a distinct appeal
made, too, by the sheen and glitter of certain textiles and the
scintillating, flickering light of the later periods of Tieck's work
is presaged as erly as this. On the whole, however, it is not the
glitter of the world of out-of-doors, but of the world of the shut-in,
of the world of little things which appeals so strongly to
Tieck and which he treated with such banality in the story
"Ulrich der Empfindsame."</p>

<p>Thus, Tieck's landscape criticism is very bad and even tho, as
has been pointed out, the basis for his adjectivs lies in the <i>Anzeigen</i>
articles, his expansion beyond them brings no real betterment.
In the plate from "Love's Labor Lost" (IV, 1, page 9),
when Tieck was feeling his way into his subject, his general impression
was one of plesure, and so the landscape is "reizend."
In the whole essay, "reizend" is the only constructiv epithet
applied to landscape and it occurs only twice. Hamilton's landscape
is purely conventional and, except for a vista, of which
Tieck was all his life fond, offers nothing to commend it. The
failure of Tieck to judge rightly must be laid at the door of too
great reliance on the <i>Anzeigen</i>.</p>

<p>Tieck criticizes only one other landscape as such, tho in a
third case a landscape background is discust adversly. For the
scene from "As You Like It" in which Jacques watches the
wounded deer the term "reizend" seems quite impossible. Engraved
by Middiman after Hodges, a combination which augurs
ill, the scene is without dout the worst in every way that Tieck
saw. The composition is bad: Jacques, a figure without grace
of expression, sprawls in a comedy landscape and the features of
the wounded deer hav a strong Hebraic cast. Here, if ever, the
scene is drawn from the stage and not from nature and stage
properties are models for tree and foliage. When Tieck says
that the scene is one to arouse cheerfulness in the beholder, he
is correct but not in the sense that he ment. The reliance on
his source is not enuf to account for his aberration; the failure
to judge aright must be laid at Tieck's door.</p>

<p>After pointing out the value of the whole, and the effect made
by the light of the torch held by Gloster ("Lear," III, 4), Tieck
shows that this effect, striking as it is, detracts from the unity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[P:26]</a></span>
the composition, since it shifts the emfasis from Lear and his
pain. Lear, morover, is not the Lear of Shakspere but a giant,
and the effect of this Herculean form is made further improbable
by the exaggeration of the wind blowing from all directions in
the picture and driving the garments of Lear with it, winding
them impossibly about him. The effect of these draperies, says
Tieck, is baroque and there is no thought of quiet strength or
noble simplicity.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In the composition of this picture Tieck also notises that the
figure of Edgar is practically the same as that of a figure in
West's Deth of General Wolf. A comparison with the latter
picture at once reveals the justness of Tieck's observation. The
figure of the Indian seated in the foreground is strikingly like
that of Edgar, both in form and in general expression, and it is
evident that West has repeated himself. In general, Tieck does
not make comparisons of this kind. He confines his remarks to
the picture itself, and probably was not well acquainted with the
run of contemporary British art.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Tieck's judgment of composition did not go far beyond this
emfasis on the principal figure. A general series of colorless
frases like "gut geordnet" occurs, but expresses only a mild acquiescence
in the arrangement. Tieck was fond of the posing sentimentalities
of groups like the landscape plate from "Love's
Labor Lost," but he tries hard to get away from them toward a
realism which drew upon actual perception for its postulates and
which was not based upon premises&mdash;inadequate for art&mdash;of Shakspere
illustration. On the other hand, and here he departs constantly
from the canon of Lessing, there is no striving for abstract
beauty. Charm and grace, beauty in motion as it is exprest
by the female figure in Anne Page and a few other cases,
are Tieck's nearest approach to it.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The general reason for Tieck's failure is that in actuality these
pictures were not ugly or inartistic to him. Where he criticizes
it is oftenest the idea; the execution and the relation to an abstract
standard are of less consequence, and his theory once
more limps behind his practis. He may berate Hogarth as an
artist without beauty but it is clear that his extoling of Rafael
is a mere matter of fashion; he is in the same category with
Domenichino, whom Tieck's generation and the next succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[P:27]</a></span>
one considerably overestimated. In Michaelangelo, Tieck knows
the strength of the drawing and not the wistfulness that pervades
even the most Titanic of the master's creations. In general,
affectation of pose, mannerism and preciosity are Tieck's
bane only where the sentimental is not concernd.</p>

<p>An interesting commendation of the composition of a plate is
that of Kirk's picture from "Titus Adronicus" (IV, 1). Tieck likes
the plate because of its taste and delicacy in only suggesting the
mutilated arms of Lavinia. Kirk has avoided the frank naturalism
of the original by the use of draperies, and this appeals to
Tieck as a toning down and is in line with what had been suggested
before in regard to Tieck's attitude.</p>

<p>This plate has an accessory which Tieck objects to, namely the
over large colum in the background. Usually, but not in this
case, Tieck criticises the accessories from the standpoint of the
stickler for historical accuracy, rather than for any artistic merit
or demerit. So the tomb of the Capulets in "Romeo and Juliet"
is not Italian of the period, and the dresses of the women in
"Merry Wives" are in violation of the sumptuary laws of the
time.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In the deth of Mortimer (1 "Henry VI.," V, 2) the
family tree lying on the ground adds a tuch of symbolism which
Tieck approves, tho in the same scene he criticizes the mean
character of the prison, saying that for such a noble prisoner a
better place of incarceration would hav been found.</p>

<p>Tieck makes no clear distinction between passing expression
(Ausdruck) and permanency of feature (Miene). His discussion
of expression goes hand in hand with composition, since, as was
mentiond above, composition has so close a relation to the
placing of the principal character. There is a definit point of
view, however, in Tieck's discussions of composition; in his
strictures and encomiums on expression of face and figure it is
practically impossible to find a consistent <i>pou sto</i>. In places, his
powers of observation seem to hav deserted him and his lapses
are not attributable to a too great leaning on the articles in the
<i>Anzeigen</i>. Tieck's theoretical discussion of the common-sense
element in these illustrations may be ever so clear and his demands
on the artist may be ever so high, but his practical application
of these principles is by no means as strict as might be
expected. Indeed, in theory Tieck demands one thing and in
practis another.</p>

<p>It is Tieck's desire that the artist should catch the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[P:28]</a></span>
note in these figures and raise it to an ideal, that he should
choose the expression with care and never sacrifice it to coloring
or drapery and that he should avoid all necessity of using symbols
to designate his characters. But when Tieck actually examins
the pictures, he stresses theatrical pose or mien and pays
no attention to those obvious tricks whereby expression is obtainable:
the skilful use of light and shade on the face, the
treatment of the lines of the mouth, and the placing of the eyes.
Occasionally, as in the ball scene in "Romeo and Juliet," it
seems as if the treatment of the eyes of a figure&mdash;in this case
that of Tybalt&mdash;attracted his attention, but there are so many
other plates in which the eyes are quite as good and are nevertheless
past over, that the instance of Tybalt seems fortuitous.</p>

<p>Tieck uses the expressions "ohne Ausdruck," "wenig Ausdruck"
and "ohne Charakter," "wenig Charakter" almost exclusively
in his negativ criticism of the plates and his positiv
criticism substitutes "viel" for "wenig." Such frases are not
very definit and Tieck misapplies them constantly. In four out
of the five cases of Tieck's largest caption, "ohne Ausdruck,"
he is certainly incorrect and the postulation of "wenig Ausdruck"
is wrong in at least two out of the three cases. It is not
a matter of personal opinion nor can it be a difference in point
of view between the twentieth century and the end of the eighteenth.
It is largely bad judgment on Tieck's part. In the
three cases where Tieck sees "vielen Ausdruck" not one is in
reality especially distinguisht for vividness. Two even vie with
the most expressionless in feature and hav no special pretentions
to significance of posture. In the five plates where Tieck uses
"ohne Charakter" or "wenig Charakter," the epithets are in
general tru.</p>

<p>Tieck got the hint for an advers criticism of the faces of Mrs.
Ford and Mrs. Page from the <i>Anzeigen</i>. He exclaims, expanding
his model, "Welch' widrige Gesichter! welch' uninteresante
Figuren!" There is in the pose of Mrs. Page a most awkward
droop of the neck, but in Mrs. Ford's face there is a rollicking
Irish drollery, a freshness of complexion and a witchery of the
eyes that are quite charming. The painting was by Peters,
whose "sprightly humor" was so much admired by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>One of the two pictures of Leontes in the "Winter's Tale"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[P:29]</a></span>
shows his giving the oath to Antigonous to destroy the child.
In Leontes' frowning face Tieck sees no expression, altho it is
unquestionably one of the most lively of the series. The stiffness
of pose that Tieck objects to in the picture may well be accounted
for by the full suit of armor that Leontes wears. The
face is far more expressiv than that of the other Leontes picture
and yet Tieck's judgment on them is the same.</p>

<p>One of the most striking failures on Tieck's part to see character
interpretation of real subtlety is in Northcote's portrayal
of "Richard III." There can be no dout that Tieck's general
dislike of the artist, which was based on the adverse criticisms of
the <i>Anzeigen</i>, led his judgment astray. The face of Richard is
all in all the most characteristic of the series in so far as Tieck
saw the series. Richard's "subtle, false and trecherous" look
with the smile of his grim humor is well caught; the eyes and
mouth are excellent and giv a very adequate idea of the deviltry
of the man, of his lewd cunning and his scheming. What Tieck
might well hav objected to is the sentimentalizing of the two
princes whom the artist has transmogrified into fat little babies,
just as in the next picture the two hav become well-fed little
beef-eaters.</p>

<p>As Tieck fails to see sentimentality in this picture, so he misses
extravagance in the church scene from "Much Ado." Tieck
borrowd much in this discussion from the <i>Anzeigen</i> but his remarks
on expression are his own. He says that Leonato has too
little expression. There can be no dout as to the figure intended
for Leonato. Claudio is identified by a very theatrical gesture
and by a Mefistofelian Don Juan behind him. The fainting
Hero, over whom Beatrice is bending, falls into Benedix' arms.
The only other figure, that of an older man, and who therefore
cannot be Benedix, is standing in a most theatrical posture with
clencht fists, eyes upturnd, rigid and ridiculous. If Tieck ment
that this figure should represent Leonato, he has shot wide of
the mark in his criticism and displays a most unrefined love of the
melodramatic. Figures like this are not often found in the
"Gallery." Ordinarily excess of sentiment and a cheap display
of emotion giv way to stiffness and awkwardness.</p>

<p>Tieck was dissatisfied with all the reproductions of Lear. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[P:30]</a></span>
hav all too much of the gigantic, too little of the childish old man.
He points out that the face as drawn by F&uuml;essli expresses nothing
but rage; the same exaggeration is found in the drawing of West
who sacrifices truth, nature and emotion to a striking first impression.
Barry's Lear only excites laughter and the lack of expression
in the face is made up by the storm-wind in the hair.
Again, however, issu must be taken with Tieck's attitude, for it
is impossible to regard these faces as expressionless. It is not
that they hav too little, but too much, and of a wrong kind.
Tieck nowhere draws the clear distinction and nowhere makes it
evident that he regards "Ausdruck" as a term to be interpreted
in any but a common sense way.</p>

<p>It seems apparent that those plates which had a certain sentimentality,
a certain saccharin quality appeald to Tieck. He
likes the prettiness of Anne Page and cleverly notes the touch
of scorn in her face. If he had recalled Reynolds' Mrs. Siddons
he would hav recognized the same trait of hardness around the
mouth, a line that is often found in the pictures of English women.
Perhaps Tieck's interest went hand in hand with his enthusiasm
for Rafael, and lack of discrimination lets him take all as
of equal value. The face of young Lucius in "Titus Adronicus"
and the face of Juliet in the tomb are examples of this. Tieck
argues that the boy has a good deal of expression, but a cool observer
can see only melodrama in the pose and blankness in
the face. The most interesting thing about the plate has escaped
Tieck's attention, namely that both of Titus' hands are represented.
It seems an especially noteworthy omission in a picture
which Tieck praises for not showing the stumps of Lavinia.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Tieck several times criticizes a picture for making a good first
impression and then not being able to stand the test of close observation.
An example of this is Northcote's portrayal of Mortimer
and York (1 "Henry VI.," II, 5) which is really spoild according
to Tieck by the strong light masses which at first sight
seem very striking. These light masses throw the main figure
into relief, but Tieck objects to the unnatural posture of the dying
man. Close examination of the figure reveals the fact that
Mortimer is really well drawn; the lines of the drapery distort
the general impression, but that part of the drawing comprising
the actual sitting figure is that of a broken old man, fallen in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[P:31]</a></span>
heap and dying. Any one who has seen Irving's masterly representation
of the dying Louis cannot but be imprest by the verisimilitude
of Northcote's presentation. What Tieck says of the
minor characters on the plate is true; they are expressionless in
the extreme.</p>

<p>Tieck is fully justified in calling Reynolds' scene from "Henry
VI." "dieses abscheuliche Blatt," where the word "abscheulich"
is reminiscent of the <i>Anzeigen</i>. He asks further, "Ist dies
der K&uuml;nstler der Familie des Ugolino?"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> With much better
right he might hav askt, "Is this the painter of the 'Age of Innocence'
and the man who loved to paint children?" Both the
Shakspere plate and the stiff Ugolino picture attempt to portray
the horrible, and the only other plate that Sir Joshua did for the
"Gallery," namely, the Hecate plate from "Macbeth," the same
selection of a grewsome subject is made. Neither of these pictures
can be sed to conform with Reynolds' well-known doctrin
that the function of art is to arouse the imagination, for in these
pictures there is nothing left for the imagination but exhaustion.
They show a vein of the bizarre without the great fancy of
F&uuml;essli and are realistic to a degree that stopt at nothing. It is
not to be wonderd at that Tieck exhausts himself in condemnation
of the plate that he saw.</p>

<p>It is plain that Tieck saw in the plate a caricature and an
evasion. The caricature was the dying man and the evasion
was the veild face of the young king. Tieck felt that the artist
had veild the face of his character to conceal his want of skill in
the portrayal of a supreme moment of emotion. Here Tieck
certainly breaks with the doctrin of Lessing who praised the expedient
of Timanthes in veiling the face of Agamemnon at the
sacrifice. Tieck tacitly accuses Reynolds of shirking an obvious
task. He wisht something superlativ, whether in fleeting expression
or in that permanency which is caused by iterativ
emotion. Such a desire, the emfasizing of Shakspere's "Kraft"
and "Energie" leaves him on the plane of the Storm and Stress
in his attitude toward the British poet.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If the words of Sir
Joshua himself are to be taken as a criterion, his theory is different
from his practis in this case, and Tieck has condemd him
out of his own mouth.</p>

<p>Beauford, whom Tieck calls a caricature, certainly leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[P:32]</a></span>
nothing to the imagination, as Reynolds wisht for art.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Tieck's
description of the figure is apt, "Beauford liegt da, mit den
Z&auml;hnen grinsend, das Bett in Verzuckungen kneifend, eine
ekelhafte, verzerrte Caricatur, &uuml;ber die man lachen k&ouml;nnte,
wenn sie etwas weniger abscheulich w&auml;re. Genie and Enthusiasmus
k&ouml;nnen hier die Hand und Kritik unm&ouml;glich irre gef&uuml;hrt
haben; denn weder das eine, noch der andere geh&ouml;rt dazu, um
diese Z&uuml;ge, diese Umrisse hervorzubringen."</p>

<p>The word caricature is, even before he found it in the <i>Anzeigen</i>,
a term of deepest reproach with Tieck. In his essays to
Wackenroder he says, speaking of a certain actor, "Ich gestehe
dass er vielleicht viele Scenen nat&uuml;rlich und einige komish darstellt,
aber nach meinem Urtheil spielt er in keiner einzigen
sch&ouml;n, mit einem Worte, er macht Carrikatur, und die kann nie
sch&ouml;n sein, wenn sie auch noch so vielen Ausdruck hat. Das
Komische und das Schreckhafte gr&auml;nzen &uuml;berhaupt vielleicht
n&auml;her aneinander, als man glaubt ... Vielleicht ist das
wahre komische Spiel so wie Unzelmann est giebt, alles so leicht,
so &uuml;bergehend, keine Periode, keine Idee, keine Stellung m&ouml;glichst
festgehalten, keine Grimasse in Stein verwandelt."</p>

<p>After pointing out the value of the unspoild taste of childhood
in matters of esthetic judgment, Tieck continues: "Du
kannst leicht die Erfahrung machen, dass Carrikaturen den Kindern
nie gefallen, denn sie erkennen in ihnen nur mit M&uuml;he den
Menschen wieder, sie f&uuml;rchten sie wirklich; sie k&ouml;nnen ungleich
l&auml;nger eine andre Figur ohne Ausdruck und bestimmten Charakter
betrachten, ja tagelang dar&uuml;ber br&uuml;ten, und Ausdruck und
Charakter hineintragen, hundert Tr&auml;ume spinnen sich in ihrer
Seele aus, ... Carrikaturen gefallen &uuml;berhaupt vielleicht
nur einem kalten n&ouml;rdlichen Volke, dessen Gef&uuml;hl f&uuml;r den feinen
Stachel der stillen Sch&ouml;nheit zu grob ist, oder die schon die
Schule der Sch&ouml;nheit durchgegangen sind, und deren &uuml;bersatten
Magen nur noch die gew&uuml;rztesten Speisen reizen k&ouml;nnen, die es
daher gern sehen, wenn die Sch&ouml;nheit dem Ausdruck aufgeopfert
wird, weil sie in der Sch&ouml;nheit keinen lebenden Ausdruck mehr
finden. Du wirst sehen, dass ich hier nicht bloss von der komischen
Carrikatur spreche, sondern von jedem Ausdruck irgend
einer Leidenschaft, der die Sch&ouml;nheit ausschliesst." He then
goes on to indicate the relation of what he had sed to Lessing
and confesses his indetedness to him in the matter. The highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[P:33]</a></span>
effects when used in sculpture and painting are also caricature.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Paralel to this statement in the letters is the discussion in the
essay of the valu of the comedies of Shakspere over his tragedies
as material for illustration. Tieck says (page 15), "Im
Trauerspiele ersteigen meistentheils gerade die sch&ouml;nsten Scenen
eine H&ouml;he des Effects, die der Maler schwerlich ausdr&uuml;cken
kann, ohne widrig zu werden. Der Schauspieler verliert schon
oft jene Grazie, die jedem Kunstwerke n&ouml;thig ist, wenn er
manche Scenen der tragischen Kraft so wiedergeben will, wie er
sie im Dichter findet, doch kann die Mimik hier noch das Unangenehme
vermeiden; der Malerei ist es aber meist unm&ouml;glich,
denn jene Verzerrungen, die auf der B&uuml;hne nur vor&uuml;bergehend
sind, werden hier bleibend gemacht; dort erschrecken sie durch
ihr pl&ouml;tzliches Entstehen und Verschwinden, hier werden sie
ekelhaft, weil durch das Feststehende und Bleibende des Widrigen
der dargestellte Mensch zum Thier herabsinkt. Jemehr der
Maler den Affekt hinauftreibt, desto mehr nimmt er zugleich
Interesse und Tadel von seinem Helden. Die h&ouml;chsten Grade
des Zorns, der Wuth oder der Verzweifelung bleiben im Gem&auml;lde
stets unedel; selbst der Wahnsinn muss hier mit einer gewissen
Sch&uuml;chternheit auftreten, und im h&ouml;chsten Entz&uuml;cken muss ein
sanfter Wiederschein der Melancholie leuchten." The relation
of this to Lessing, both in the "Laokoon" and in the "Dramaturgie"
is at once apparent.</p>

<p>The dislike for caricature centers around the comic efforts of
Smirke for whom Tieck has hardly a good word to say. In the
discussion of Reynolds' picture, Tieck remarks, half in jest, that
he regrets his strictures on Smirke in the face of this greater
caricature by Reynolds. The sum total of his criticisms of
Smirke is unjust: thruout the series and especially in some of the
plates that Tieck saw, this painter has caught the comic spirit
well, and tho overpraisd by his contemporaries, has done some
very clever work both in the "Gallery" and in Bell's "British
Theater."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Tieck's principal censures are directed against the figure of
Simple in the "Merry Wives" and that of Dogberry in the comic
trial in "Much Ado." Simple is for Tieck neither the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[P:34]</a></span>
as Shakspere conceived him, nor is he funny. It is again, says
Tieck, a mere exaggeration, tantamount to a confession of inability.
That the spectator cannot laugh at the character is the
artist's greatest punishment; in overstepping the just limits of
the comic and the natural, he has made the figure insignificant.
Unlike Hogarth, says Tieck, Smirke has not the power of expressing
character by means of the distortions of the exterior.
To put an artist below Hogarth is with Tieck to put him very
low; in this respect he stands on the plane of August von
Schlegel in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> and has not risen to the level of admiration
for the Englishman displayed by Novalis in the "Fragments."</p>

<p>The best that Tieck can say for the Dogberry scene as a whole
is, that in spite of its exaggerations, it has much comic power.
But, he goes on to explain, it is a far different thing for Smirke
to exaggerate than for Shakspere, for the latter always draws
human beings, while the figures of the former are at times hardly
to be distinguisht from apes.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the figure of Dogberry and more especially
the face, justify Tieck's repugnance. In its way, the face is
fully as bad as that of Reynolds' Beauford. Tieck says, "Selbst
ein vertrauter Leser des Shakspeare findet sich nicht in den hier
dargestellen Caricaturen, von denen die Hauptperson in einer
Wuth, die l&auml;cherlich sein soll, so ekelhaft verzerrt wird, dass
man nur ungern mit dem Blick auf dieser Zeichnung verweilt."
This is in every respect tru. Smirke has here mist all the
comic elements of the character, and has produced not the
ridiculous malapropian Dogberry but a demoniac grinning mask
of a face and a twisted, distorted and frenzied figure. Tieck
proceeds, "Ein K&uuml;nstler, der die komischen Scenen des Shakspeare
darstellen will, sollte doch von seinem Dichter so viel gelernt
haben, dass dieser seine Caricaturen nie ohne eine gewisse
Portion von phlegmatischer Laune l&auml;sst, die so oft unser Lachen
erregt, und aus der blossen Erfahrung sollte er wissen, dass
selbst der l&auml;cherlichste Zwerg, wenn er sch&auml;umt, in eben dem
Augenblicke aufh&ouml;rt l&auml;cherlich zu sein. Jedes Subject h&ouml;rt auf,
komisch zu sein, sobald ich es in einen hohen Grad von Leidenschaft
versetze. Denn das L&auml;cherliche in den Charakteren entsteht
gew&ouml;hnlich nur durch die seltsam widersprechende Mischung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[P:35]</a></span>
des Affects und des inneren Phlegma; wenigstens so hat
Shakspeare seine wirklich komischen Personen gezeichnet.
Der Mangel an Genie zeigt sich gew&ouml;hnlich in Uebertreibung
und gesuchten Verzerrungen des K&ouml;rpers."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The scene from the "Merry Wives" in which Dr. Cajus catechizes
William on his Latin, represents very well the type of
scene the choice of which Tieck condems as unsuited for representation.
It is not because there was something in the humor
of them that Tieck did not grasp, but because he rejects on principle
all that is secondary and episodical. Such scenes as are
told and not acted, that is, the epic portions of the plays, as
well as the reflectiv and filosofical portions would hav to be excluded.
It is the fate of the principal characters which is of
prime importance, and the moment must be chosen with their
activities in view. This emfasis on the principal character is
also strongly reminiscent of the doctrin of Lessing's "Dramaturgie."
It has been shown how it affects what Tieck has to say
about composition and it is the prime factor in his feeling for
what is the proper moment and subject of representation.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes which Tieck rejects are Hodges' picture of
the melancholy Jacques, and the murder of the princes in "Richard III."
Neither of these is acted out on the stage. From the
"Merry Wives" he proposes Falstaff's three adventures: the
basket scene, the Witch of Brentford scene and the final torturing
of Falstaff by the practical jokers. These giv a chance for
variety of grouping and a gradation of expression in all the chief
characters of the play. The scene in which the two women
read identical letters from Falstaff, Tieck regards as the worst
possible, for reasons that he says he need not recall but which
are obviously those of lack of stress on the main character.</p>

<p>The scenes that Tieck recommends were actually chosen by
the artists whose work appears later in the series and so Tieck's
judgment is, in a way, confirmd. These scenes are the skeleton
of the farce element and bring out the structure of the Falstaff
plot which Tieck evidently regards as the main theme. It
is interesting to note, however, how little the choice of subject
has to do with the artistic merit or demerit of the plates. The
subsequent plates, which would hav fully satisfied Tieck's requirements
as to the moment of presentation are artistically
among the worst in the series.</p>

<p>The two scenes from "As You Like It" suggested by Tieck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[P:36]</a></span>
the one where Adam admonishes Orlando (II, 3) and the scene
in the forest where Orlando enters bearing Adam on his shoulders
(II, 7) hav not the same structural relation to the whole as hav
those from the "Merry Wives." These moments lend themselves
very well to representation but are chosen on another
basis of judgment. They show that for Tieck Orlando was of
more importance than Rosalind, for he suggests no scene with
her in it as especially representativ of the play. In the first of
these two scenes, the action has already begun; the scene is the
culmination of the episode containing the first relation of the
brothers. It is in itself not a vital part of the action. The
scene in the forest, on the other hand, has more of the qualities
demanded by Tieck: a variety of characters and an important
moment. This is a moment&mdash;tho not the initial one&mdash;when Orlando's
fortunes mend and he comes to his frends. The scene
in which he first meets the Duke's party is of more significance.
It seems as if the governing principle is contrast rather than a
desire for elucidation of structure in serial arrangment. Orlando
and Adam, ill-fortune and good luck, are juxtaposed.</p>

<p>Tieck conjectures that the eavesdropping scene from "Much
Ado" (III, 1) is included in the collection because it was played
by popular actresses of the contemporary English stage. Tieck
misses the structural importance of the scene. It is apart of the
intrigue; it has a direct effect on Beatrice who comes from it a
changed woman. To Tieck, however, it ment as little as the
similar eavesdropping scene from "Love's Labor Lost" (IV, 3),
in which play he claims there is no suitable scene for representation.</p>

<p>The scene from "Winter's Tale" in which Perdita welcomes
the disguised Duke (IV, 3), offering him flowers the while, is
condemd in favor of the one immediately following in which the
Duke discloses himself. Here again Tieck stresses the contrast
and wishes a climax, a dramatic moment. So he praises such
scenes as the putting away of Hero at the altar and the deth of
Beauford, however much he derides the execution of the latter,
by Reynolds.</p>

<p>For the sake of bringing out the wretchedness of this execution,
Tieck points out that tho he has often before bewaild the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[P:37]</a></span>
choice of moment, he cannot do so in this case for no better
could hav been selected. He details the good points in the
scene: "Man denke sich einen B&ouml;sewicht auf dem Todtenbette,
den die Verzweifelung wahnsinnig gemacht hat, der keine Seligkeit
hofft; diesen besucht in seiner Todesstunde Heinrich, der
junge gef&uuml;hlvolle K&ouml;nig, ein Schwarmer in der Religion, der
von diesem Anblick auf das tiefste ger&uuml;hrt wird; Warwick und
Salisbury, zwei m&auml;nnliche Krieger, begleiten ihn hierher. Beauford
ist die Hauptperson, alle Zuschauer haben ihre gauze Aufmerksamkeit
auf ihn gerichtet. Der K&uuml;nstler h&auml;tte hier r&uuml;hren
und ersch&uuml;ttern k&ouml;nnen; ich sehe in Gedanken den weichen
Heinrich Thr&auml;nen vergiessen, im sch&ouml;nsten Contrast mit dem
Cardinal, der ihn, in der Abwesenheit seines Geistes, kalt und
ohne Bewusstsein anstarrt. Warwick und Salisbury, weniger
ger&uuml;hrt, aber doch interessante Physiognomien, die durch
leichtere Nuancen von einander unterschieden sind. So sehe
ich in der Phantasie das sch&ouml;nste tragische Gem&auml;lde ..."</p>

<p>In "Romeo and Juliet" the choice of the ball scene meets
with Tieck's disapproval. The scene is "Ohne Wirkung." Tieck's
main reason why the scene is not good is that the painter
has interpreted literally the metafor, "My lips two blushing pilgrims
stand" and has represented Romeo in the garb of a pilgrim
to correspond to Juliet's anser, "Good pilgrim." As Tieck
rightly points out, there is no need for such a gise. The choice
of the more highly keyd situation at the supposed deth of Juliet
meets with Tieck's approval and shows that where there is a
choice, the emfasis of his selection is apt to be on the superlativ
moment.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>One other idea seems to be in Tieck's mind and it is hard to
believe that he was not unconsciously influenced by the stage
presentation of the plays when formulating it. That is the desire
to hav a number of people in the picture. Nearly all the
plates that he condems hav but few characters and his dictum of
variety demands a reasonable number to choose from. This dramatic
point of view is in accord with his attitude in all other
fases of the discussion. It has been pointed out how rarely the
artistic makes the prime appeal to him.</p>

<p>Tieck's second point in regard to choice of subject is that the
comedies offer a wider field and a better opportunity than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[P:38]</a></span>
tragedies. The general basis for this notion is allied to his
theory of the worthlessness of caricature, that is, that there is
an exaggeration, an overacting of the part possible in tragedy
that is less likely to occur in comedy.</p>

<p>The statement of the evils of exaggeration is very sweeping
and includes in some of its details both comedy and tragedy:
"Der dramatische Dichter hat Momente in seinen Schauspielen,
die kein Pinsel oder Griffel jemals darstellen kann; ich meine
jene Spr&uuml;nge und &uuml;berraschenden Wendungen des Affectes, jene
f&uuml;rchterlichen Blitze des Genies, bei denen der Zuschauer zusammenf&auml;hrt,
wo der Dichter unerwartet durch eine neue verdr&auml;ngt:
diese Momente sind oft die gl&auml;nzendsten des Schauspiels,
und bei keinem Dichter finden sie sich so h&auml;ufig als bei
Shakspeare in seinen Trag&ouml;dien." Tieck's illustration for this
is the passage from Lear beginning, "No, I will weep no more,"
etc. He continues, "welcher Maler wird es wagen, wenn er
den Sinn ganz durchdringt, ... diese Stelle auf die Leinwand
zu werfen? So innig diese Verse beim Lesen oder bei
der Darstellung r&uuml;hren, so frostig w&uuml;rden sie vielleicht als ein
Gem&auml;lde dargestellt erscheinen: oder wenn sie auch hier r&uuml;hrten,
so w&uuml;rde das Gem&auml;lde doch nie jene Ersch&uuml;tterung in uns
erregen, jenes Anschlagen von hundert Gef&uuml;hlen. Man w&uuml;rde
immer nur den weinenden Lear sehen oder den erz&uuml;rnten Vater,
der sich zur K&auml;lte zwingt; das Ineinanderschmelzen dieser beiden
Empfindungen, verbunden mit der Verstandesschw&auml;che,
die dem Schmerz endlich ganz erliegt und Wahnsinn wird, w&auml;re
selbst ein Rafael unm&ouml;glich: hier steht ein grosser Grenzstein
zwischen dem Gebiet des Malers und des Dichters."</p>

<p>The result of overstepping these bounds is that the painter is
likely to enter into rivalry with the poet, to feel his lack of ability
in the struggle and to produce empty declamation insted of
a work of the creativ imagination and to offer to the spectator
nothing for either imagination or reason.</p>

<p>But in the comedies there are many moments which almost
force themselves on the painter. These are scenes in which he
can portray the poet just as he finds him and in which his rivalry
is legitimate and, indeed, may tend to make him surpass the
poet. If he can do this it will be by bringing out more plainly
the light shades of the poet's meaning and he will become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[P:39]</a></span>
commentator, so to speak, of these. Under such circumstances,
the painter must be very careful to choose just the most beautiful
and most interesting passages.</p>

<p>The relation to Lessing is again at once clear. The culminating
moment of passion as it appears in the tragedies is not
suitable from the artistic point of view for reproduction but the
comedies, from their admixture of the flegmatic, the almost imperativ
concomitant of Shaksperean humor, tone down this
superlativ expression and are therefore within the pale. How
Tieck carries out his theory in practis, has been sufficiently
shown: his love for the sentimental and melodramatic, for the
climatic and striking lead him to neglect his delimiting theoretical
remarks.</p>

<p>Before leaving the discussion of Tieck's article, it may be well
to compare it with another contemporary treatment of the Boydell
Gallery. This is by the famous traveler and publicist,
George Forster. It was Forster's account which furnisht Fiorillo
with much of his data for the treatment of the "Gallery" in his
history of British art, but it is hardly likely that the account is
a source for Tieck. I hav no external evidence and the internal
evidence is entirely negativ.</p>

<p>If Friedrich Schlegel's estimate of Forster's artistic capabilities
be accepted, it is just such pictures as these, where the social
interest is great and the artistic valu is secondary, that should
bring out Forster's strength of judgment. Forster was also a
finely discriminating amateur, with a decided sense of tactile
form based on a sincere love of Greek art and confirmd by a
study of Winkelmann and Lessing, beyond whom he past in his
appreciation of the portrait and the landscape and of the coloring
of the great masters.</p>

<p>Forster's essay, "Die Kunst und das Zeitalter" (1791), was
written about the time that he saw the Boydell pictures. It
shows his attitude toward Greek art and givs more than a hint
of his standards which point so clearly toward Schiller. His
"Ansichten vom Niederrhein," especially the discussions of the
galleries and collections at D&uuml;sseldorf, Brussels and Antwerp
fully express his ideas on Dutch and Flemish art, especially emfasizing
the characteristics of Rubens for whose fleshy types
Forster had little use.</p>

<p>In the discussion of British art which comes as an appendix to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[P:40]</a></span>
the "Ansichten," Forster includes a rather detaild description of
the Boydell paintings. He did not see the engravings, or rather,
his description is based on the paintings as they hung in the
gallery in Pall Mall and so the material of this sketch in two
parts, is in one way fundamentally different from that of Tieck.
All the discussion of technique in which Tieck was so weak, is entirely
lacking in Forster. His point of view, too, is different.
He is the traveld, experienced man from whose traind eye and
broad judgment more may be expected than from the student
Tieck. There is, as Friedrich Schlegel says, an out-of-doorness
in Forster's work that Tieck could never hav had; the over-emfasis
on Shakspere on the part of the latter is only one product
of his inexperience.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, it is surprizing to find what correspondences
there are between the student Tieck and the more traind
Forster. The latter who knew vastly more of English life than
Tieck, fails to understand it in just those vital points where
Tieck went farthest astray. Smirke and Peters fare badly at his
hands, perhaps because of a certain puritanism in his atitude, or
to quote Schlegel, because "Keine Vollkommenheit der Darstellung
konnte ihn mit einem Stoff auss&ouml;hnen, der sein Zartgef&uuml;hl
verletzte, seine Sittlichkeit beleidigte oder seinen Geist
unbefriedigt liess." For this reason he can call one of the
Peters paintings from the "Merry Wives" a brothel (ein Speelhuis)
or refer to the women of that artist as "lockere Nymphen."</p>

<p>Besides the same general dislike for the caricatures of Smirke
that was noted in all previous instances, there is the usual praise
of Hodges, the usual condemnation of Opie's bad drawing.
F&uuml;essli, too, comes in for his share of the blame: "Der Beifall,
welchen F&uuml;esslis Gem&auml;lde in England erhalten, bezeichnet mehr
als alles die Ueberspannung des dortigen Kunstgeschmacks.
Dieser junge Schweizer ... brachte nebst der Kenntniss
akademischer Modelle sein malerisches Kraftgenie mit sich &uuml;ber
das Meer; seiner Phantasie ward es wohl unter wilden Traumgestalten
und Bildern des Ungew&ouml;hnlichen. Diese Stimmung ... verf&uuml;hrte
ihn nur gar zu bald zu allen Ausschweifungen
der Manier. Es ist zwar leicht das Allt&auml;gliche zu vermeiden,
indem man Kontorsionen darstellt ..." (page 466). Again:
"Es sind nicht Menschen, die dieser K&uuml;nstler phantasiert, sondern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[P:41]</a></span>
Ungeheuer in halb menschlicher Gestalt, mit einzeln sehr
gross gezeichneten und sehr verzerrten, verunstalteten Theilen
und Proportionen: ausgerenkte Handgelenke, aus dem Kopfe
springende Augen, Bocksphysiognomien u. s. f...." (page
503). Northcote is damned with the faint praise "Nicht ohne
Verdienst," a frase that clings to the characterizations of his
work from the <i>Anzeigen</i> to Fiorillo. Barry is shown to lack
grace, noble greatness and beauty. His distorted figures border
on caricature and his forms are of giants, colossi. His coloring
is bad in spite of his theoretical knowlege and good drawing.</p>

<p>Forster sees thru Angelika Kaufmann and Hamilton better than
Tieck did. Hamilton's paintings are "Machwerk" and his figures
move in "Tanzschritt," while Angelika's are hermafroditic (page
501). "Die deutsche Muse Angelika verbarg die Inkorrektheit
und das Einerlei ihrer allzuschlanken Figuren unter dem
Schleier der Grazie und Unschuld" (page 459).</p>

<p>For Forster, Shakspere is the most logical portrayer of nature
that ever existed; he meets the painter halfway in his work by
his excellent characterization of the salient features of a personage
and so givs the painter sharply defined subjects for his
fantasy. For the artists of the British school this is especially
valuable because effect is their highest aim and beauty only secondary.
Extremes of passion, astonishment, surprize are strivn
for. "Sie hascht nach der Wahrheit der Natur in ihren gr&auml;sslichen
Augenblicken und erlaubt ihrer Phantasie den verwegenen
Flug, nicht in das sch&ouml;ne Feenland des Ideals sondern in die
verbotene Region der Geister und Gespenster."</p>

<p>But while the general condemnation of British artists shows
far more perspectiv than is found in Tieck, the acquaintance
with the details of Shakspere's plays is never drawn on to point
out any defects in choice of subject matter. Forster can refer
to the acted plays from an experience that was at this time still
denied Tieck, but this experience does not result in any well-defined
theory of Shakspere-illustration as a whole and as we
found Tieck to hav. The melancholy Jacques in the forest is
a good scene for Forster, whereas Tieck rejected it as having no
structural relation to the rest of the play. Forster finds it
worthy of portrayal as one of the moments arising from Shakspere's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[P:42]</a></span>
variety of scene, character and condition of life, to say
nothing of the chance to show the lonesome melancholy stag by
the famous animal painter, Gilpin!</p>

<p>On Reynolds' famous Beauford picture, Tieck and Forster are
entirely at odds. For Tieck the execution is terrible, the choice
of subject satisfactory. For Forster, the choice is inexcusable,
the execution in part masterly; a dying criminal in his last
throes seems to Forster an utterly impossible subject for representation.
So with Kirk's picture from "Titus Adronicus": in
spite of the attempt to meliorate the impression of the butcherd
Lavinia, the whole picture remains for Forster a disgusting
sight. The conclusion is obvious: Forster's sense of delicacy rebeld
at the crass and brutal; wildness and terror shockt him.</p>

<p>But if Tieck's article compares favorably with Forster's in all
points respecting the "Gallery" itself, it must be confest that the
political, patriotic note, the application to Germany of the
principles of national betterment in art which arose in the mind
of Boydell, escape him. He was not, of course, like Forster, a
political writer, and revolutionary conditions had no immediate
interest for him as for the older man. And so his art criticism
does not look forward to Germany as does Forster's or as does that
of a propagandist like Kleist in his <i>Abendbl&aelig;tter</i> article. Tieck
does not rise above the milieu; the "Gallery" offers no hold with
which to test contemporary art in his own land. It is only a
beginning, clearsighted in part and in general sustaind, an ernest
of what the matured criticism of the Romantic school was later
on to do.</p>

Tieck mentions in all 39 plates; of these 24 are large plates and the
rest small ones. In only 6 instances does Tieck enter into even a slite
criticism of the small plates. In some cases, his remarks are so meager

plate he means.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> In his Academy discourses. Bohn ed., vol. I, page 460 ff.
Reynolds points out that those who praise the "invention" of Timanthes
in the Agamemnon picture hav not been painters but literary men. They
use it as an illustration of their own art. He says, "I fear that we
have but very scanty means of exciting those powers over the imagination
which make so very considerable and refined a part of poetry. (Cf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[P:47]</a></span>
Boydell's preface.) It is a doubt with me if we should even make the
attempt. The chief, if not the only occasion which the painter has for
this artifice, is when the subject is improper to be more fully
represented, either for the sake of decency, or to avoid what would be
disagreeable to be seen; and this is not to raise or increase the
passions, which is the reason given for this practice, but on the
contrary to diminish their effect.... We cannot ... recommend an
undeterminate manner or vague ideas of any kind, in a complete or
finished picture. This notion, therefore, of leaving anything to the
imagination opposes a very fixed and indispensible rule in our
art,&mdash;that everything shall be carefully and distinctly expresst, as if
the painter knew, with correctness and precision, the exact form and
character of whatever is introduced into the picture. This ... must not
be sacrificed ... for uncertain and doubtful beauty which, not naturally
belonging to our art, will probably be sought for without success."
After praising the artifis of Timanthes, Reynolds goes on to say,
"Suppose this method of leaving the expression of grief to the
imagination, to be ... the invention of the painter and that it deserves
all the praise that has been given to it, it is still a trick that will
serve only once; whoever does it a second time, will not only want
novelty, but will be justly suspected of using artifice to evade
difficulties. If difficulties overcome make a great part of the merit of
Art, difficulties evaded can deserve but little commendation." Among the
names of those who discuss the "trick" Lessing's is, of course, wanting.
Gilray's satirical plate on Boydell should be compared for this and
other points. Copy in N. Y. Public Library.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> In this connection, the letters mention Engel's
"Mimik"(1785).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Some of the latter pictures by Smirke are very fine; e.
g., the face of Jessica which justifies the statement of the Dict. Nat.
Biog. that Smirke had "good drawing, refinement, quiet humor." Bryan has
a cooler comment: "Smirke was well spoken of in the comedy vein." Tieck
likes him better in tragedy (page 34). Fiorillo's comment is "Seit
Hogarths Zeiten hat kein K&uuml;nstler so viel Charakter oder so viel
Ausdruck in seine Figuren gebracht, noch eine Scene mit so viel echter
Laune bearbeitet."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> To me the Tieck-Schlegel translation of this scene misses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[P:48]</a></span>
all the best points of the original. To be sure, Tieck had nothing to do
with its translation. (Friesen, I, 136; Sybel, III, 463 ff). It was not
that Tieck was not interested in puns, altho the Dr. Cajus scene seems
uninteresting to him on that account. Tieck himself made a good many
puns. Cf. "Viehsiognomie," the first lines of his sonnet on the sonnet
and the "gemein" from the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i> in "Das
j&uuml;ngste Gericht." His sensing of English puns seems not to hav been so
keen. So in a discussion of Mss. readings toward the end of the essay on
the erly English Theater (Kr. Sch. I, 320) after calling one faulty
reading "Unsinn" he continues, "In derselben Rede:
</p><p>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">If you can construe but your doctor's bill<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Parse your wife's waiting woman, etc.<br /></span>
</p><p>
Parse? Was kann das bedeuten? Pierce ist dem aufmerksamen Auge leserlich
genug." Tieck seems to hav mist the play on the grammatical idea. To be
sure, I hav not seen the Ms., but Tieck was no very careful reader or
copyist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> This is a scene where Tieck saw both L. and S. There were
two different paintings of the same subject, one with fewer figures, and
Tieck rightly points out that the less crowded one is the better. One of
the engravings is by W. Blake and is not given in any list of that
artist's work. Mr. W. G. Robertson, the most recent biografer of Blake
informs me in a letter that he does not know it.</p></div>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
